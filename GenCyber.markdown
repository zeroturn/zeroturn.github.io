GenCyber or "Generation Cyber" is the cybersecurity educational program sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the National Security Agency.  Expense paid training is offered to teachers and students to increase cybersecurity awareness and to prepare students for jobs in the field of cybersecurity.  In their own words:

> Our vision is for the GenCyber program to be part of the solution to the Nation’s shortfall of skilled cybersecurity professionals. Ensuring that enough young people are inspired to direct their talents in this area is critical to the future of our country’s national and economic security as we become even more reliant on cyber-based technology in every aspect of our daily lives.

The job market for persons skilled in cybersecurity is *exploding*.  This is an opportunity that should not be missed.  If you are a teacher or student interested in computer security, you should do everything in your power to enroll in one of the trainings.  The trainings are **intense** and **free** for attendees.  You will not find a better deal on the planet!  Follow [this link](http://www.gen-cyber.com/ "GenCyber website") for more information on the GenCyber program.
