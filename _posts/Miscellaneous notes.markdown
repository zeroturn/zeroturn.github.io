One-Click installation of Ghost on Heroku
https://github.com/cobyism/ghost-on-heroku

**Heroku seems to mangle Ghost**.  Don't use it.

[Simple way](http://markmiyashita.com/blog/how-to-deploy-a-static-site-using-github-pages/) to post static html to Github pages.

`Buster` can be used to export Ghost blog as static html.  See [here](https://stefanscherer.github.io/setup-ghost-for-github-pages/).

Online markdown code editor with simultaneous view and export to html at Dillinger.io.  [Here](http://dillinger.io/)
