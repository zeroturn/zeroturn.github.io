This is a cybersecurity learning resource project based upon the [port](https://github.com/rosario/kasper) for Jekyll of the [Casper](https://github.com/tryghost/casper) theme of the Ghost blog.  The website for this project is [here](http://zeroturn.github.io/).

This project is in the early stages of development.  Our focus now is cybersecurity training for interested middle and high school students.

We want to encourage students and teachers to get involved with the [GenCyber](http://www.gen-cyber.com/) educational program sponsored by the NSF and NSA, and also the [CyperPatriot](https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/) Competition sponsored by Northrop-Grumman and the Air Force Association.
